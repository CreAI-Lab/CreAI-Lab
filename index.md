# Welcome to the CreAI lab website!
We investigate intelligence and creativity in humans and AI. Our research examines how well these AI-models replicate human cognitive abilities — such as reasoning, analogy-making, and creative thinking — and what their successes and limitations reveal about both artificial and human minds.

We are located at the Psychological Methods unit at the University of Amsterdam.
